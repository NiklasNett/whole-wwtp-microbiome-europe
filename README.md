# “Whole Microbiome Analyses of Wastewater Treatment Plants across Europe” (University of Cologne, 2025)

This repository contains all scripts, supplementary data tables, and the final genus-level count matrix used in the data analysis for the paper:  
*“Whole Microbiome Analyses of Wastewater Treatment Plants across Europe”* (DOI: 10.1111/jeu.70112)

The study investigated how latitude and season influence microbial community composition across seven European wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We built upon the metagenomic dataset from Becsei et al. (2024; DOI: 10.1038/s41467-024-51957-8), which focused solely on bacteria, and extended the analysis to include eukaryotic microorganisms, providing a more complete picture of environmental drivers and potential cross-community interactions.

To ensure full reproducibility, this repository includes Bash scripts for data retrieval, preprocessing, and taxonomic assignment, as well as R scripts used for statistical analyses and visualizations.
